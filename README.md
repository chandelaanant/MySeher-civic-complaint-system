# MySeher-civic-complaint-system
Web-based civic grievance management system connecting citizens and authorities.
Overview

MySeher is a web-based civic complaint and grievance management platform designed to help citizens report, track, and manage local civic issues such as garbage collection, road damage, water supply problems, and public infrastructure concerns. The system aims to improve transparency and streamline communication between citizens and authorities.
Problem Statement

Civic issues are often reported through unstructured, manual, or inefficient channels, leading to delays, lack of accountability, and poor visibility into resolution status. Citizens rarely know whether their complaints are acknowledged or acted upon.
MySeher addresses this gap by providing a structured digital platform for complaint submission, tracking, and management.
